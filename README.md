# React Intern Assignment - Spreadsheet Prototype

A pixel-perfect React prototype that matches the provided Figma design for a spreadsheet application.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Pixel-perfect UI**: Matches the Figma design exactly
- **Google Sheets-like Experience**: Full spreadsheet functionality with cell selection, keyboard navigation
- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons and tabs are functional with console logging
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for cell navigation (stretch goal implemented)
- **Column Management**: Hide/show columns functionality (stretch goal implemented)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility styling
- **Custom Table Component** (no external table library dependency)
- **Lucide React** for icons

## ðŸ“‹ Implemented Features

### Core Requirements âœ…
- [x] Pixel-close layout to Figma design
- [x] Google Sheet/Excel-like spreadsheet experience
- [x] All buttons/tabs change state or log to console
- [x] Clean TypeScript with strict mode
- [x] Tailwind CSS styling
- [x] Responsive design

### Stretch Goals âœ…
- [x] Keyboard navigation within the grid (arrow keys)
- [x] Column hide toggles
- [x] Cell selection with visual feedback
- [x] Interactive sorting and filtering (UI ready)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Components

- **SpreadsheetApp**: Main container with state management
- **SpreadsheetSidebar**: Left navigation panel
- **SpreadsheetHeader**: Purple header with breadcrumbs
- **SpreadsheetToolbar**: Action buttons and search
- **SpreadsheetTable**: Main data grid with cell selection

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Fidelity

The prototype matches the Figma design including:
- Exact color schemes (purple header, status badges, priority colors)
- Typography and spacing
- Interactive states and hover effects
- Layout proportions and component positioning
- Icon usage and placement

## ðŸ”§ Interactive Features

- **Cell Selection**: Click any cell to select it
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to move between cells
- **Search**: Real-time filtering of table data
- **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort (with visual indicators)
- **Column Toggle**: Hide/show columns via toolbar
- **Action Buttons**: All toolbar buttons trigger appropriate actions

## ðŸš¦ Code Quality

- ESLint and Prettier configured
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Clean component architecture
- Proper event handling and state management
- Accessible markup with proper ARIA labels

## ðŸ“± Usage

1. Click on any cell to select it
2. Use arrow keys to navigate between cells
3. Use the search bar to filter data
4. Click column headers to sort
5. Use toolbar buttons for various actions
6. All interactions are logged to console

## ðŸŽ¯ Trade-offs

- Used custom table component instead of react-table for better control over styling
- Focused on visual fidelity over advanced spreadsheet features
- Implemented core functionality with extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Prioritized TypeScript safety and code organization

The prototype successfully demonstrates a production-ready React application with excellent attention to design detail and user experience.
